A refactored code from the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBzaMfV94uA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBzaMfV94uA</a>.

The `feature/pure_gmpy2` branch contains a version that uses only the `gmpy2` library. For demonstration purposes, the original method presented by the video's author is preserved in the `master` branch, along with my modifications.
